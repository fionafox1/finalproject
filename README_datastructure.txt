The results of the Yelp API have been structured into trees. This has been done in order to create recommendations for the user based on their responses
to the questions posed in the tree. 

The user will be prompted to answer the following 3 questions:
Would you like to visit somewhere urban or rural?
Would you like to experience the arts or the outdoors?
Would you like to go somewhere popular or unpopular?

Based on the responses to these questions they will recieve a recommendation from 8 possible places which are all stored as a leaf.
Tree structure can be found in the json_data.json file. Execution of the tree can be found in the final.py file.
